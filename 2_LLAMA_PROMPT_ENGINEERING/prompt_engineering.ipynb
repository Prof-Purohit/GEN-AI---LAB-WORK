Find a comfortable seated position, close your eyes if it feels right for you, and take a few deep breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth. As thoughts come into your mind, acknowledge them without judgment and then gently bring your focus back to your breath. Try to maintain this focus for at least five minutes. If you find yourself getting distracted, simply acknowledge the distraction and return your focus to your breath.

        "Here are some additional questions your students might have regarding the provided code and the concepts involved, along with potential explanations:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **What is the purpose of the `post_process_response` function?**\n",
        "   The `post_process_response` function is designed to clean up the raw output generated by the language model. It removes any leading or trailing whitespace, replaces newline characters (`\\n`) with spaces, and removes any consecutive spaces. This post-processing step helps to present the model's output in a more readable and cleaner format.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Why are we using different prompts?**\n",
        "   The code demonstrates the concept of prompt engineering, which is the practice of carefully crafting prompts to guide the language model towards generating the desired output. By using different prompts (`mentalhealth_prompt_phind`, `mentalhealth_prompt_gemini`, `mentalhealth_prompt_claude`, `mentalhealth_prompt_chatgpt`, `mental_health_promt`, and `SYSTEM_PROMPT2`), you can observe how the model's responses vary based on the prompt's structure, context, and framing.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **What is the significance of the `print` statements?**\n",
        "   The `print` statements are used to display the model's responses to the different prompts. This allows you to visually inspect and compare the outputs, which can be useful for understanding the impact of prompt engineering and evaluating the model's performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Can you explain the process of fine-tuning a language model?**\n",
        "   The code you provided is using a pre-trained language model (Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2-GGUF) from Anthropic. However, you can also fine-tune a pre-trained model on a specific task or domain to improve its performance. Fine-tuning involves further training the model on a labeled dataset relevant to the target task, adjusting its parameters to better capture the nuances and patterns of that task. This process can lead to improved accuracy and performance on the target task.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **How can we evaluate the quality of the model's responses?**\n",
        "   Evaluating the quality of language model responses can be a subjective task, as it involves assessing factors like coherence, relevance, factual accuracy, and overall quality. One approach is to have human evaluators rate the responses based on predefined criteria. Alternatively, you can use automated metrics like BLEU, ROUGE, or perplexity to quantitatively measure certain aspects of the responses, although these metrics have their limitations.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Can we use different models or libraries for this task?**\n",
        "   Absolutely! The code you provided uses the ctransformers library and the Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2-GGUF model from Anthropic. However, you can explore other libraries like Hugging Face Transformers or PyTorch, and experiment with different pre-trained models like GPT-3, GPT-J, or models from Google, Meta, or other organizations. Each model and library may have its own strengths, weaknesses, and areas of specialization, so it's worth exploring various options.\n",

            "\n",
            "In the quaint little hamlet of Willowbrook, nestled between the verdant arms of the Whispering Woods, lived an unassuming man named Archibald Thorne. A retired schoolteacher with a penchant for botany and all things whimsical, he spent his days tending to his garden, which was a riot of colors and fragrances that would put the most renowned horticulturist to shame.\n",
            "\n",
            "One sun-kissed autumn afternoon, as Archibald pruned his roses, his gnarled hand unearthed something unusual - an object half-buried beneath the loamy soil. It was a shard of emerald, as translucent and vibrant as the heart of the Emerald City itself. The stone was smooth to the touch, yet it seemed to hum with an otherworldly energy that sent a shiver down Archibald's spine.\n",
            "\n",
            "Intrigued by this enigma, he took the emerald shard inside his quaint cottage and placed it on his writing desk, where it seemed to glow with an ethereal light. As the days passed, Archibald found himself drawn to the stone, unable to focus on anything else but its allure. He began to keep a journal of his observations, documenting every minute detail about the shard's behavior.\n",
            "\n",
            "One fateful evening, as twilight painted the sky in hues of pink and gold, Archibald sat by the fireplace, the emerald shard resting on the table before him. The room was filled with an eerie silence, broken only by the gentle crackling of the logs and the distant hoots of an owl.\n",
            "\n",
            "Suddenly, the shard began to pulsate with a soft, rhythmic glow. Archibald's heart raced as he watched the emerald's surface ripple like water, revealing a scene beneath - a lush, enchanted forest teeming with fantastical creatures. The sight was breathtakingly beautiful and terrifying at the same time.\n",
            "\n",
            "As Archibald stared in awe, a figure emerged from the forest, beckoning him closer. It was an ethereal being, its form shifting between that of a woman and a tree, her eyes as deep and mesmerizing as the emerald shard itself. She spoke to him in a voice that resonated through his very soul.\n",
            "\n",
            "\"Archibald Thorne,\" she whispered, \"you have been chosen to bear the burden of my power. With this shard, you can bring forth life or destruction, depending on your intentions.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "Archibald was stunned, his mind reeling from the revelation. He asked the enchantress if he could use her gift for good, to help his beloved hamlet of Willowbrook flourish. She nodded in approval and bestowed upon him the power to manipulate nature with a simple touch of the emerald shard.\n",
            "\n",
            "Archibald returned to his garden, filled with newfound excitement and purpose. He used the shard to nurture his plants, making them grow faster and stronger than ever before. The people of Willowbrook marveled at the transformation, their once barren land now teeming with life.\n",
            "\n",
            "However, as Archibald's power grew, so did the whispers of envy and fear from those who had not been blessed with such a gift. They began to plot against him, seeking to steal the emerald shard for their own nefarious purposes.\n",
            "\n",
            "One fateful night, as Archibald slept, his cottage was besieged by a band of rogues, led by the cruel and covetous Mayor Grimsby. They had come to claim the shard for themselves, believing it would grant them unlimited power.\n",
            "\n",
            "Archibald awoke with a start, his heart pounding in his chest as he saw the intruders. He reached out for the emerald shard, but it was gone - stolen by the Mayor and his cronies. With a heavy heart, Archibald knew that he had been betrayed.\n",
            "\n",
            "Desperate to reclaim what was rightfully his, Archibald sought the help of the enchantress. She revealed that the shard could only be retrieved by proving himself worthy through an act of selflessness and love.\n",
